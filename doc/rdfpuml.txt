NAME
    rdfpuml - Convert RDF to PlantUML diagrams

SYNOPSIS
      perl -C -S rdfpuml.pl file.ttl                   # makes file.puml
      java -jar plantuml.jar -charset UTF-8 file.puml  # makes file.png

DESCRIPTION
    Converts an RDF Turtle file to a readable diagram using PlantUML
    <http://plantuml.com>.

  Motivation
    The best way to understand RDF data schemas (ontologies, application
    profiles, RDF shapes) is with a diagram. Many RDF visualization tools
    exist, but they have shortcomings, eg

    *   Focus on large graphs, where the details are not easily visible

    *   Visualization results are not satisfactory

    *   Manual tweaking of the diagrams is required

    rdfpuml makes true UML diagrams directly from Turtle examples, with a
    small amount of tweaking that can be done with "puml:" formatting
    triples (this follows the approach from Circles and arrows diagrams
    using stylesheet rules <https://www.w3.org/2001/02pd/>, Dan Connolly,
    W3C 2005).

    Benefits:

    *   Guarantees consistency between what you say (triple statements) and
        what you show (diagram)

    *   Lets you focus on domain modeling rather than diagram
        layouting/tweaking

    *   Enables efficient source control

    *   Saves you lots of effort

  Features
    Diagram readability is a prime concern. rdfpuml implements the following
    features for maximum readability.

    *   Shorten URLs aggressively. Some prefixed names you see in the
        diagram are not valid Turtle

    *   Show inline as much as possible: literal values, types, and nodes
        declared as "puml:Inline"

    *   Sort properties by name (rdf:type comes first)

    *   Show literal datatypes, use Turtle shortcuts (eg 1 instead of
        "1"^^xsd:integer)

    *   Collect property values together; collect "parallel" relations
        together

    *   Show reified properties as UML Associations

    *   Allow node decorations such as stereotypes, colored circles (and in
        the future: background color and icons)

    *   Allow arrow decorations such as head, dashed, colored

    *   Allow control of arrow directions

    *   Allow hidden arrows to tweak the layout

  Prefixes
    rdfpuml prepends prefixes.ttl if it finds such a fule, so when you make
    a set of examples, you can keep all your prefixes in one file.

    It also predefines the following prefixes:

       puml   => 'http://plantuml.com/ontology#'
       rdf    => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
       rdfs   => 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#'
       skos   => 'http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#'
       crm    => 'http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/'
       crmx   => 'http://purl.org/NET/cidoc-crm/ext#'
       frbroo => 'http://example.com/frbroo/'
       crmdig => 'http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/CRMdig/'
       crmsci => 'http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/crmsci/'
       leak   => 'http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leak/'

    "puml" is used for PlantUML formatting triples, see below. "rdfs" and
    "skos" are used to display node labels. The rest are used for
    reification (see below).

  Parallel Arrows
    Multiple property instances between nodes are collected in one arrow and
    shown as several labels. Inverse arrows work fine.

See F<img/CONA-arel-replaced-MultipleArrowLabels.png>
  Reification
    In RDF, Reification is an approach where a statement s p o is
    represented as a class instance with 3 "addressing" properties and then
    additional properties are added to elaborate the statement (eg
    probability, effective date range, who assigned the statement, etc).

    This approach has been used in RDF for many years using the RDF
    Reification vocabulary <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#reification>.
    It was developed for CIDOC CRM in the paper Types and Annotations for
    CIDOC CRM Properties
    <http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pubs/Alexiev2012-CRM-Properties.pdf>
    and is used for British Museum data ("bmo:EX_Association,
    bmo:PX_property"), see Reified Association
    <https://confluence.ontotext.com/display/ResearchSpace/BM+Association+Ma
    pping+v2#BMAssociationMappingv2-TranslatedCodeInReifiedAssociation>.

    rdfpuml recognizes a number of reification "situations" and renders them
    as a UML Association
    <http://plantuml.com/classes.html#Association_classes>, for example

See F<img/CONA-arel-Reification.png>
    RDF Reification looks like this:

      [] a rdf:Statement; rdf:subject s; rdf:predicate p; rdf:object o; <statement metadata>

    "rdf:Statement" is the reification class, "rdf:subject, rdf:predicate,
    rdf:object" are the addressing properties, and it can be applied over
    any shortcut property p.

    The Property Reification Vocabulary
    <http://smiy.sourceforge.net/prv/spec/propertyreification.html> (PRV)
    can be used to describe other reification situations, using terms like
    in the table below. rdfpuml recognizes the following situations, and in
    the future you should be able to provide your own PRV descriptions.

      REIFICATION CLASS             SUBJECT PROP                   SHORTCUT PROP                    OBJECT PROP                 SHORTCUT
      _____________________________ ______________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________ __________________________________________

      crm:E15_Identifier_Assignment crm:P140_assigned_attribute_to crmx:property                    crm:P38_deassigned          crm:P1_is_identified_by, crm:P102_has_title
      crm:E16_Measurement           crm:P39_measured               crmx:property                    crm:P40_observed_dimension  crm:P43_has_dimension
      crm:E17_Type_Assignment       crm:P41_classified             crmx:property                    crm:P42_assigned            crm:P2_has_type or subprop
      frbroo:F52_Name_Use_Activity  frbroo:R63_named               crmx:property                    frbroo:R64_used_name        crm:P1_is_identified_by, crm:P102_has_title
      crmsci:S4_Observation         crmsci:O8_observed             crmsci:O9_observed_property_type crmsci:O16_observed_value
      leak:Edge                     leak:hasSource                 <none>                           leak:hasTarget

    For CIDOC CRM we need a new extension "crmx:property" to point to the
    property being reified (the shortcut), similar to how "rdf:predicate" is
    used. Even for a specific CRM reification class like
    E17_Type_Assignment, the shortcut property is not fixed to
    "crm:P2_has_type": we may need to reify a sub-property thereof, e.g.
    "crm:P72_has_language".

    Visuals: the shortcut is shown as a normal relation. The reification
    node is attached to the relation usign a dashed line. It is
    automatically positioned below or to the right of the relation,
    depending on the relation's direction. The 3 "addressing" properties are
    shown inside the reification class, and there are little characters in
    front of them to point to the subject ("←" or "↑"), property (".." or
    ":") and object ("→" or "↓").

    Limitation: you can show as reified a maximum of 2 relations between the
    same nodes, and even that is ugly.

See F<img/CONA-titles-NoReify.png>
    If you don't want to show a relation as reified (either because it's the
    third one between the same nodes or for other reasons, use the
    "puml:NoReify" class to tell rdfpuml not to reify it, e.g.

      cona_term:1000000718-contrib-10000016 a puml:NoReify.

See F<img/CONA-types-reification.png>
  Inlines
    In order to save space, rdfpuml inlines various resources in the subject
    node, rather than as a separate node. All literals and types are inlined
    automatically. In addition, you can inline other nodes by using the
    following.

    "puml:Inline"
        Shows a single node inline. This is used quite often for lookup
        values, e.g.

          <cona/event/competition> a puml:Inline.
          cona_contrib:10000000 a puml:Inline; rdfs:label "Getty Vocabulary Program".

    "puml:InlineProperty"
        Declares a property to be inlined, i.e. all its objects are shown
        inlined, e.g.

          fn:annotationSetFrame a puml:InlineProperty.
          fn:annotationSetLU    a puml:InlineProperty.

        E.g. this is used in this complex diagram showing FrameNet nodes.

See F<img/MS-Frame-complex.png>
  Labels
    Nodes can have labels: "puml:label, rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel".

    *   If a node is inlined, its label is added as a comment. If several
        nodes are inlined at the same property, all their comments are also
        gathered together.

    *   If a node is shown normally, its label is shown amongst the other
        node attributes.

    *   "puml:label" is used to give a label without any predicate
        (attribute) name. It's printed in red (but only if single-line).
        It's used with completely different meanings in rdf2rml (to specify
        a SQL table or join) and in rdf2sparql (to specify a row filter): I
        know this is a hack.

  Arrow Customization
    rdfpuml allows you to customize arrows by using properties like
    "puml:DIR-HEAD-LINE-COLOR-LEN". You can combine the different parts
    freely (each is optional) and even write them in different order.

    DIR Arrow direction: "left, right, up" or "down" (default)

    HEAD
        Arrowhead (end): "none" (use for symmetric properties), "tri"
        (hollow triangle), "star" (filled dot), "o" (empty dot).

        WARNING: "o" has a bug
        <https://forum.plantuml.net/12278/o-sets-wrong-arrow-direction>: it
        sets the arrow direction to the opposite of what was specified.

        TODO: allow customizing the arrowtail (beginning).

    LINE
        Line style: "dotted, dashed, bold, hidden".

        "dotted, dashed" are exclusive of each other; "bold" can be used
        alone or with them. "hidden" can be used to adjust the layout by
        constraining node positions, and is exclusive of the other line
        attributes.

        This example shows using the parameters "DIR-HEAD-LINE-COLOR". We
        emit the same relations in the "puml:" namespace (to customize the
        arrow) and in the empty namespace (to show an arrow label).

             <x> puml:none-right  <y1>. <x> :none-right  <y1>. 
             <x> puml:dashed      <y2>. <x> :dashed      <y2>. 
             <x> puml:dotted-bold <y3>. <x> :dotted-bold <y3>. 
             <x> puml:up-black    <y4>. <x> :up-black    <y4>. 
             <x> puml:tri-up      <y5>. <x> :tri-up      <y5>. 
             <x> puml:left-blue   <y6>. <x> :left-blue   <y6>.

See F<img/arrowStyles.png>
    COLOR
        Line color: name (e.g. "red") or hex-code (e.g. "FF0000") To see the
        full list of color names supported by PlantUML, use this command and
        search for ";color"

          java -jar plantuml.jar -language

        For example, 4 of the arrows on this diagram are colored (1 green, 3
        red):

See F<img/colorArrow-ciq-cropped.png>
    LEN Length: a number of 1 or 2 digits. This applies only to vertical
        arrows ("up,down"). You can use this to adjust the layout and in
        some cases avoid the need for parasitic "hidden" arrows.

        See this example
        <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/JOvB3iCW30NtFeKlm2B_NPMhq80A4Y
        GH6DMvVLCtZM0tCvOUSoQTgCG0pXkBDkvqe2PA_bd8vjf6IsupbrfyMiBPbw1pHcw06r
        HcUw_gWST9BQgogo-qmDsLX3lW_XS5U-3Xpc86u54E_c84dgeJSPDC9FzofEft3zH9VZ
        7RrPGOFW00> and its remake in rdfpuml below.

             <x1> puml:down     <y1>.
             <x2> puml:up-2     <y2>.
             <x3> puml:down-3   <y3>.
             <x4> puml:up-4     <y4>.
             <x5> puml:down-5   <y5>.
             <x6> puml:up-6     <y6>.
             <x7> puml:down-7   <y7>.
             <x2> puml:right-9  <y3>.
             <x4> puml:right-7  <y2>.

See F<img/arrowLen.png>
   Arrow Per Edge
    To customize the arrow of one relation connecting two nodes, use:

      <node1> <prop> <node2>
      <node1> puml:DIR-HEAD-LINE-COLOR <node2>

    The arrow will show the label "prop" but the style specified with
    "puml:DIR-HEAD-LINE-COLOR"

   Arrow Per Property
    To customize the arrow for all relations with the same property, use:

      <prop> puml:arrow puml:DIR-HEAD-LINE-COLOR.

    E.g. on the diagram "Inlines", the following declaration was used to
    point all "nif:oliaLink" arrows upward:

      nif:oliaLink puml:arrow puml:up.

  Stereotypes and Colored Circles
    Stereotype <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_(UML)> is UML lingo
    for "role". In PlantUML these include a «guillemetted italic label» and
    colored circle.

      puml:stereotype "(LETTER,COLOR)LABEL"

    where "LETTER" is a single uppercase letter, "COLOR" is a color name or
    hex-code (see </COLOR>), "LABEL" is a label, and all the parts are
    optional.

    You can set stereotype on an individual node or a whole class, e.g.
    (referring to the previous diagram):

      <#char=32,34_annoSet> puml:stereotype "(F)Frame"
      fn:AnnotationSet      puml:stereotype "(F)Frame"

    Here is an example that also sets stereotype labels:

      gvp:GuideTerm      puml:stereotype "(G,green) Concept".
      gvp:Concept        puml:stereotype "(C,lightblue) ThesaurusArray, OrderedCollection".
      iso:ThesaurusArray puml:stereotype "(A,red) ThesaurusArray, OrderedCollection".

See F<img/GVP-ordered-collection-Stereotype.png>
    Here is a bigger example that also shows how arrow directions are
    handled. It's a diagram for the Duraspace Portland Common Data Model
    <https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki> for digital library metadata
    (Fedora, Islandora, etc): a remake of one of the Reference Diagrams
    <https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/PCDM%2BMappings%2B-%2BReference%2
    BDiagrams%2Bfor%2BComment>. (A proposal to make PCDM diagrams with
    rdfpuml <https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki/Diagrams-with-rdfpuml>
    is tracked as duraspace/pcdm#46
    <https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/issues/46>)

See F<img/PCDM_Multi_Page_Text-circles.png>
  Blank Nodes
    Although the use of blank nodes is not recommended in semantic modeling,
    they are supported by rdfpuml. No special triples are needed for this.

    E.g. below is a diagram of EXAMPLE 41: Complete Example
    <https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#h-complete-example> from the
    Web Annotation Data Model <https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/>.

    As you can see, 10 nodes on the right side are blank nodes (have no
    URL). The tiny one in the middle has no attributes whatsoever, only the
    "rdf:first, rdf:next" outgoing links. It should have had a type
    "rdf:List", this is an omission in the example.

See F<img/OA-eg41.png>
  PlantUML Options
    You can pass options and pragmas to PlantUML using the "puml:options"
    property (attached to an empty node). The default options are as per
    plantuml.cfg:

      [] puml:options """
        hide empty members
        hide circle
        skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
      """;

    You can use "left to right direction" to fit diagrams with large nodes
    (see two examples below). Don't forget to add the "hide" options, else
    you'll get unwanted compartments and circles in nodes:

      [] puml:options """
        hide empty members
        hide circle
        left to right direction
      """;

    You can also try your luck with smetana
    <https://plantuml.com/smetana02>, which uses an internal Java
    implementation of GraphViz instead of an external C program. One way to
    invoke "smetana" is by adding a pragma to "puml:options". See
    text/saref4city for another way, and a trial.

        !pragma layout smetana

    First example (test/saref4city):

See F<../test/saref4city/example1-saref4city.png>
    Second example (test/permid):

See F<../test/permid/sample-RobinSmith-positions.png">
  Unicode
    The input Turtle can include Unicode chars (accented chars, Cyrillic,
    etc). Please invoke the script with option "-C" for proper processing of
    Unicode, eg:

      perl -C -S rdfpuml.pl file.ttl

    (The option "-S" causes Perl to search for the script in "PATH".)

    That's how the included bin/rdfpuml.bat invokes the script.

  Limitations
    Round brackets in labels eg "(1975)" are converted to square brackets,
    eg "[1975]". PlantUML interprets round brackets as a function (method)
    and renders them below a line, so I had to implement this hack.

  Prerequisites
    GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>

    PlantUML <http://plantuml.com/download>, see in particular plantuml
    class diagrams <http://plantuml.com/class-diagram>.

    Perl. Tested with version 5.22 on Windows (cygwin and Strawberry).

    Perl modules: RDF::Trine, RDF::Query, Encode, FindBin, Carp::Always,
    Slurp.

    RDF::Prefixes::Curie. This is my own module located in ../lib, and
    rdfpuml needs FindBin to locate it.

  Installation
    Until rdfpuml is published as a proper perl package, use the following
    procedure:

    Install the prerequisites.

    Add rdfpuml/bin to your path.

    Use rdfpuml/bin/rdfpuml.bat to run it:

      perl -S rdfpuml.pl %1

    See test/*/Makefile for examples how to set up make.
