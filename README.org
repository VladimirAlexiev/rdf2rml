RDF is a graph data model, so the best way to understand RDF data schemas (ontologies, application profiles, RDF shapes) is with a diagram. 
Many RDF visualization tools exist, 
but they either focus on large graphs (where the details are not easily visible), 
or the visualization results are not satisfactory, 
or manual tweaking of the diagrams is required. 

We describe a tool *rdfpuml* that makes true diagrams directly from Turtle examples using PlantUML and GraphViz. 
Diagram readability is of prime concern, and rdfpuml introduces various diagram control mechanisms using triples in the ~puml:~ namespace. 
Special attention is paid to inlining and visualizing various Reification mechanisms (described with PRV). 
We give examples from Getty CONA, Getty Museum, AAC (mappings of museum data to CIDOC CRM), 
Multisensor (NIF and FrameNet), EHRI (Holocaust Research into Jewish social networks), Duraspace (Portland Common Data Model for holding metadata in institutional repositories), Video annotation. 

If the example instances include SQL queries and embedded field names, they can describe a mapping precisely. 
Another tool *rdf2rdb* generates R2RML transformations from such examples, saving about 15x in complexity.

See http://twitter.com/hashtag/rdfpuml for news, diagrams and announcements.

* Documentation
- http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/master/doc/rdfpuml.html
- http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/master/doc/rdf2rml.html
Source: [[./doc/rdfpuml.pod]], [[./doc/rdf2rml.pod]]

* Installation
Checkout this repo and add ~rdf2rml/bin~ to your path. 
Install the following prerequisites:
- both tools: Perl. Tested with version 5.22 on Windows (cygwin and Strawberry).
- rdfpuml:
  - [[http://www.graphviz.org/][GraphViz]]
  - [[http://plantuml.com/download][PlantUML]]. 
    You need a recent version for new features like arrow length and color. I'm currently running 1.2018.10beta7. 
    See in particular [[http://plantuml.com/class-diagram][plantuml class diagrams]].
  - Perl modules: use ~cpan~ or ~cpanm~ to install them:
    ~RDF::Trine RDF::Query Encode FindBin Carp::Always Slurp~
  - ~RDF::Prefixes::Curie~. This is my own module located in [[./lib]], and *rdfpuml* needs ~FindBin~ to locate it.
- rdf2rml:
  - [[https://jena.apache.org/download/][Apache Jena]]: ~riot~, ~update~. Tested with version 3.1.0 of 2016-05-10.
  - cat, grep, rm


* Debian Repo
Jonas Smedegaard (@jonassmedegaard, dr at jones fullstop dk) has volunteered for some of the tasks below.
His development is at https://salsa.debian.org/debian/rdf2rml/branches.
To adopt changes, do something like this. 

- To merge *all* commits in the ~salsa/develop~ branch:
  #+begin_src sh
  cd rdf2rml    # i.e. your local clone of your Github project
  git remote add salsa https://salsa.debian.org/debian/rdf2rml.git
  git fetch salsa
  git merge salsa/develop
  #+end_src

- To adopt only single commits from the ~salsa/develop~ branch, issue ~remote~ and ~fetch~ as above, then issue:
  #+begin_src sh
  git cherry-pick $commit1 $commit2 $commit3
  #+end_src

* Change Log [3/3]

** DONE 2018-11-14 Avoid puml:stereotype class node        :VladimirAlexiev:
I often define ~puml:stereotype~ for some classes in prefixes.ttl.
If the class is not used in some particular turtle, it should avoid emitting a disconnected puml class.
- `stereotypes`: Avoid emitting
- `has_statements_different_from`: Check that a node has statements other than puml:stereotype

** DONE 2018-06-29 Bug: class and puml:InlineProperty      :VladimirAlexiev:
When a type is also used with puml:InlineProperty, it caused this error:
: Can't locate object method "uri_value" via package "RDF::Trine::Node::Literal" at rdfpuml.pl line 261.
:    main::puml_qname(RDF::Trine::Node::Literal=ARRAY(0x4fd0920)) called at rdfpuml.pl line 279
:    main::puml_node2(RDF::Trine::Node::Literal=ARRAY(0x4fd0920)) called at rdfpuml.pl line 128
An inline is converted to a literal, but rdf:type is always assumed to be a URL.

Test: [[./test/regression/type-inlineProperty.ttl]]

** DONE 2018-04-05 Arrow Attributes                        :VladimirAlexiev:
Add arrow attributes (dotted, dashed, bold) and length

Test: [[./test/regression/arrowLen.ttl]]


* To Do Tasks [2/21]
Help needed for the following tasks.
Post bugs and enhancement requests to this repo!

** Near-term [2/11]

*** INPROGRESS Modularize and Package Better

*** INPROGRESS Regression Tests
- ~sort~ is added at various places to make the tool more deterministic, i.e. independent of order of RDF statements in the input file.
  However, this will interfere with the ability to control the layout, especially of disconnected components (see [[https://forum.plantuml.net/2538][layout_new_line]])
- Some regression tests are added.

*** TODO Release on CPAN

*** DONE Easier installation
There's a pull request https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/pull/7 that dockerizes the installation.
As of 18-Sep-2019 it's undergoing code review.

*** Unicode [0/2]
**** TODO Get rid of ~myprint()~
This was made because of some Unicode troubles
**** INPROGRESS Add Unicode tests
Add ttl with non-ASCII chars: Accented, Cyrillic, French, etc.
- Accented: ~"Rudolf Mössbauer"~ in [[./test/TRR/societyMember.ttl]]

*** Prefixes [0/3]
**** TODO Eliminate Curie.pm
[[./lib/RDF/Prefixes/Curie.pm]] remembers ~@base~ and uses that for URL shortening.
Once [[https://github.com/kasei/perlrdf/issues/131][perlrdf#131]] is fixed, eliminate this dependency (local module)
**** TODO Remember prefixes from input file
~rdfpuml~ shortens URLs using prefixes only from ~prefixes.ttl~, but should also use prefixes defined in the individual input file.
**** DONE Allow specifying the prefixes file
See https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/pull/7
**** TODO Support more RDF Formats
Now it only supports Turtle, because it concatenates ~prefixes.ttl~ to the main file.
If it can collect all prefixes from RDF files, such concatenation won't be needed

*** TODO Batch Processing
#1: plantuml is slow to start up, so we'd like to process a bunch of ~puml~ files at once.
The best way is to have a smarter script or ~Makefile~ that uses the following http://plantuml.com/command-line features:
- Keep the intermediate ~puml~ files (the current ~Makefile~ doesn't preserve them)
- Run ~plantuml~ on a whole folder (with ~-r[ecurse]~ it can even recurse through subfolders)
- Use ~-checkmetadata~ to skip ~png~ files that don't need to be regenerated.
  (The whole ~puml~ text is stored in the ~png~, 
  so ~plantuml~ can quickly check that there are no changes)
- The ~Makefile~ should start ~plantuml~ only once, if some of the ~puml~ files is newer than its respective ~png~ file

**** "Manual" Batching
Before I discovered the ~-checkmetadata~ option, 
I had the idea that ~rdfpuml~ could put several diagrams in one ~puml~ file:
#+BEGIN_SRC puml
@startuml file1.png
  # made from file1.ttl
@enduml
@startuml file2.png
  # made from file2.ttl
@enduml
#+END_SRC
However, this interferes with ~make~ processing that regenerates only ~png~ for changed ~ttl~ files,
and makes things less modular overall.

** Mid-Term [0/5]

*** TODO Upgrade to use Attean
[[https://github.com/kasei/perlrdf][Trine (Perl RDF)]] is end of life. [[https://github.com/kasei/attean][Attean]] is the new generation

*** TODO Integrate in Emacs ~org-mode~
Write Turtle, see diagram (easy to do)

*** TODO Allow node colors, icons, tooltips
See [[./ideas]]

*** TODO Allow more arrows
See ~arrows arrows-2~ from https://github.com/anoff/blog/tree/master/static/assets/plantuml/diagrams:

[[./ideas/arrows.png]] [[./ideas/arrows-2.png]]

*** TODO Extra Layout Options
Local layout options are described in [[http://wiki.plantuml.net/site/class-diagram#help_on_layout][Help on Layout]]:
- "hidden" makes a constraint between two nodes, but does not draw the link (~rdfpuml~ already implements this)
- [[https://forum.plantuml.net/3188/add-norank-option-on-links][norank]] ignores a link for layout purposes (same as graphviz ~constraint=false~)
- "together" groups classes as if they were in the same package (i.e. puts them in a graphviz cluster)

Global options include (eg see [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/bP8nQmCn38Lt_mfnoq7XGZgrGoYXMJeqIpfqTkwKdeXi7xRI4kYFBvSORCSGg8OGdlJfFPbR1z5UJePLsuuq8FJaUqPr-OzcaZCOD7lq8PUqYAVzIJ2eS2GxQQyDC5cKyuJWl8mkQuHH3-w7x1SSD0TKRMfjoMvOX_19WupmjCnxrWqOS8BdGlNQ7gEg55b1Vz0zmlOIyfs2e4LVDNQECHFVDFC7-c_giHfLgct18siXPmEqhL8R9hG2LNNTIodaUyj4QMRrs-N8TNTbqJmsLuleq2mNYuS6ydDKvXQfsY66kacJzdM5NnoUVnAVtzj16MVdd56pK3350IMmSLQyOyOXldQTB8AhsIsl2arl0RVtH_G-MK2HlC_DvwPsdXN-mQMw-NxYzBruXT6hauYiqGudmty0][this diagram]]):
#+begin_plantuml
skinparam Linetype ortho
skinparam NodeSep 80
skinparam RankSep 80
skinparam Padding 5
skinparam MinClassWidth 40
skinparam SameClassWidth true
#+end_plantuml

And there are a lot more undocumented features: https://forum.plantuml.net/7095

*** TODO Custom Reification
Ability to describe custom reification situations using the Property Reification Vocabulary (PRV)

*** TODO Use MindMap/WBS for Hierarchies
Plantuml now has [[http://plantuml.com/mindmap-diagram][MindMap]] and [[http://plantuml.com/wbs-diagram][WBS (or OBS)]] diagrams that use a simple bulleted syntax to draw hierarchies.

It would be nice to use this to draw hierarchies of individuals, in particular taxonomies.

Here are examples of the two styles:

http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/SoWkIImgoStCIybDBE3IKd1szUVIqbBmLGi6Ka0wiIWxjIGpBntC2qxCIIq6IJk7W5Mv-0Q0nTsB4WioN9p0x82Sn9Aq_A9SBeVKl1IekG00

** Long-Term [0/3]
*** TODO Extend rdf2rml to describe & generate RDF Shapes
*** TODO Visualize RDF Shapes (SHACL and ShEx)
*** TODO Generate transformations for other than relational sources
R2RML works great for RDBMS, but how about other sources?
Extend rdf2rml to generate:
  - [[http://rml.io][RML:]] extends R2RML to handle RDB, XML, JSON, CSV
  - [[http://github.com/semantalytics/xsparql][XSPARQL:]] extends XQuery with SPARQL construct and JSON input
  - [[https://tarql.github.io/][tarql]]: handles TSV/CSV with SPARQL construct
